This project uses the JavaScript library Plotly.js to build an interactive dashboard
about bellybutton biodiversity. More information regarding this research can be
found here >
[Belly Button Biodiversity DataSet](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/).

## Skills Used

In this project I demonstrate my skills with Plotly, Flask, and SQLAlchemy to build
an interactive dashboard. The user can choose a sample from the dropdown box, and
a visual representation of the sample is shown. The Pie Chart shows the 10 most
common types of bacteria, while the Bubble Chart shows all the different
types of bacteria. The Gauge Chart shows how many times the bellybutton was washed
during the study.
